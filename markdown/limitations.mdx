    # Limitations

    Our API system is designed with specific limitations to ensure stable performance and usage.
    These limitations are divided into two categories: IP Limitations and API Limitations.

    #### IP limitations

    For requests originating from different regions, rate limits are implemented based on the
    requesting IP address:

    ###### Primary regions

    IPs from primary geographical regions can make up to 10,000 requests per 5 minutes.

    ###### Outside primary regions

    IPs from outside these regions are limited to 500 requests per 5 minutes or may be
    completely blocked, depending on the region.

    If the request limit is exceeded, an HTTP 429: Too Many Requests error is returned.

    #### API limitations
    Each API has distinct limitations, governing both the rate of calls and the number of
    concurrent active calls. Below is an overview:

    ###### General Data APls (DK, NO, SE)
    * Rate Limit: 1.000 calls per second
    * Concurrency: 100 active calls

    ###### Bulk Feature Store
    * Rate Limit: 10 calls per second
    * Concurrency: 1 active call

    ###### Tinglysning API
    * Rate Limit: 10 calls per second
    * Concurrency: 1 active call

    ###### Recommendation API
    * Rate Limit: 10 calls per second
    * Concurrency: 10 active calls

    Each API is managed individually, allowing the full utilization of concurrency limits across
    multiple APls. For example it is possible to maintain 100 active calls for the DK Data API
    and another 100 active calls for the NO Data API at the same time.

    This independent handling ensures flexibility and scalability when using different
    endpoints concurrently.
