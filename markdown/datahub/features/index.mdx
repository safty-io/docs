    # Understanding Features and Entities

    In Predicti Data, a **feature** is a fundamental data model representing a **single measurable or descriptive value tracked over time**. Features store historical data points, capturing how a specific attribute changes at different timestamps.

    ---

    ## What Is a Feature?

    A **feature** holds one or more values, each associated with a timestamp forming a **time series** of the attribute's state or measurement.

    ### Feature Structure Example

    ```json
    {
      "history": [
        { "2006-03-08T14:26:56Z": ["2"] },
        { "2007-05-01T10:15:00Z": ["3"] }
      ],
      "id": "11f17ae3-be00-0668-e044-0003ba298018",
      "_lastModified": "2025-06-03T11:21:46.879Z"
    }
    ```

    - `history` records changes over time: each entry links a timestamp to a list of values (usually a single value per timestamp).
    - `id` uniquely identifies this feature instance.
    - `_lastModified` tracks the last update time of the feature.

    This structure enables precise tracking of attribute changes, supporting longitudinal analysis and up-to-date status retrieval.

    ## What Is an Entity?

    An **entity** is a logical grouping or container for related features that collectively describe a real-world object or concept, such as:

    - An **address**
    - A **person**
    - A **property**
    - A **household**

    Entities organize features into meaningful sets, making it easier to navigate, query, and manage data.

    ### Example: `dk-address` Entity Features

    - address_houseNumber
    - address_postalCode
    - address_city
    - address_floor
    - address_door

    Each of these features independently tracks its values over time, maintaining a historical record.

    > See the [Address Data Features](address) documentation for more details on the `address` entity and its features.

    ## Why Use Features with Time-Series History?

    Tracking features as time series allows you to:

    - Understand how values evolve (e.g., changes in residency type, property size, or postal codes).
    - Perform trend analysis and detect patterns over time.
    - Access the most current state of an attribute as well as its history for auditing and verification.
    - Build dynamic and temporal models that react to real-world changes.

    ## Summary

    | Concept     | Description                                                     |
    | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Feature** | A single attribute storing values with timestamps (time series) |
    | **Entity**  | A collection of related features describing a real-world object |

    Together, entities and features provide a powerful framework for managing rich, time-aware data that supports accurate and flexible insights.
