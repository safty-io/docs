    # Authentication

    To access our APIs, you need an API key, which is sent to you via email after registration.
    The API key must be included in all requests by setting it in the x-api-key header.

    #### Example usage

    Below is a general example of how to include your API key in a request:

      ```bash
    curl --location 'https://api.safty.io/dk/data/household/v1/households/2d4a262b-6cb8-4ffa-b43a-da1e7887ab5e' \
    --header 'x-api-key: {{API_KEY}}'
      ```
    Replace `{{API_KEY}}` with the API key you received, and ensure it is included
    in the header for all API requests.
