    # Life Events

    Life Events is a real-time service that provides structured insight into meaningful changes in your customers’
    lives. By combining 1st-party data (portfolio data) with 3rd-party data (public registries), Life Events
    automatically identifies and delivers relevant updates such as property purchases, address changes,
    or company activity. This enables proactive communication, smarter workflows, and an always up-to-date
    understanding of your customers.

    ## Event Types

    Life Events covers a wide range of meaningful updates, including:

    * purchasing a new home or car
    * changing address
    * creating or closing a company
    * income changes
    * updates to ownership or property characteristics

    Instead of relying on static profiles or outdated information, Life Events gives you a continuously
    updated view of what is happening as it happens.

    Life Events are available for:

    * Company events
    * Person events
    * Property events

    ## How Life Events Are Generated

    Life Events are created by combining two types of data:

    * 1st-party data (portfolio data) – the persons, companies, properties, and vehicles already present
    in your portfolio, based on the data you hold in your own systems. This defines which entities Predicti
    monitors on your behalf.
    * 3rd-party data (public data) – public data sources that provide updates such as property transactions,
    address changes, company filings, ownership updates, and demographic information.

    Predicti continuously compares your portfolio with newly available public data.
    When public data contains a relevant change for an entity in your portfolio, Predicti generates
    a Life Event and delivers it immediately.

    This ensures that you only receive events related to the customers and entities already included
    in your portfolio.

    ## How Life Events Works

    Life Events uses the combined data from your portfolio and public data sources to continuously detect
    changes. To give a complete and always up-to-date picture, Life Events includes:

    ### Real-Time Events

    Delivered immediately when new information is registered in public data sources.

    ### Historical Events

    Provides insight into past activity, long-term patterns, and customer history.

    ### Event Classifications

    Each event falls into one of three classifications, reflecting how the event was generated:

    * Fact: Verified changes based on confirmed data (e.g., property purchased, company closed).
    * Model-based updates: Events generated from statistical or ML models that estimate or update a value
    (e.g., updated income estimates or the likelihood of children in the household).
    * Future predictions: Events that represent predicted future outcomes (e.g., that it is likely that
    a customer will move to a new address within the next half year).

    ## Future-Dated Events

    Some fact-driven event types can be detected before the effective date.
    A common example is a property purchase where the takeover date lies in the future.
    Even though the customer has not yet taken possession, the transaction may already be registered in public data.

    Life events deliver life events as soon as they become available, allowing you to:

    * reach out to the customer before the change happens
    * prepare onboarding steps in advance
    * trigger workflows ahead of time
    * understand upcoming shifts in the customer’s situation

    Future-dated events include:

    * eventDate – the effective future date
    * eventAvailableDate – when Predicti first detected the event

    ## Typical Use Cases

    Life Events can support many operational, advisory, and commercial workflows:

    ### Onboarding & Activation

    Trigger relevant actions when customers move, buy a property, or create a company.
    Future-dated events enable engagement even before the change occurs.

    ### Customer Retention

    Identify significant life changes early and follow up proactively.

    ### Cross-sell & Upsell

    Detect new financial needs when customers enter new life phases or acquire assets.

    ### Risk Monitoring

    Use ownership changes, financial filings, or property activity to support risk assessments.

    ### Customer Timeline

    Build a chronological view of personal, financial, and property-related activity across your portfolio.

    ## Event Model & Structure

    All events share the same structure, regardless of whether they relate to a person, company, or property.
    The only difference is the entity identifier (personId, companyId, or propertyId).

    Below is the shared structure in API order:

    ### \<entity\>Id

    Unique ID identifying the entity the event relates to.

    ### eventDate

    Date and time when the event occurred or will take effect.

    ### eventId

    Unique identifier for the event.

    ### eventType

    Type of event, such as address change, ownership transfer, financial update, or value change.

    ### eventValues

    Object containing the values affected by the event.

    ### newValues

    The new values introduced as part of the event.

    ### oldValues

    The previous values replaced by the event.

    ### eventDateAccuracy

    Indicates the precision of the event date (exact or approximate).

    ### eventAvailableDate

    Date when the event became available in Predicti.

    ### isExperimental

    Indicates whether the event is experimental. Experimental events may evolve over time as logic or data sources improve.
